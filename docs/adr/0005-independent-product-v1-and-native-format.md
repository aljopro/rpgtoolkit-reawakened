# ADR 0005 — TK Reawakened is an independent product (v1.0); a native format is permitted, not required

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Date:** 2026-10-11
* **Context documents:** [0001-typescript-core.md](0001-typescript-core.md), [spec/README.md](../spec/README.md), [editor-features.md](../editor-features.md)

## Context

The project is described in several places as a rebuild or successor of RPG Toolkit 3, or as RPG Toolkit itself coming back. That wording invites the reading that this is "RPG Toolkit 3.x" or "RPG Toolkit 4". It is neither. It is a clean-room, separate project that can open and play legacy worlds, and it should be understood, named and versioned as its own product.

**Precedent.** The project's stewards said the same thing in 2005. Phil "Xavier" Carty, steward of ToolkitZone and RPG Toolkit after Christopher B. Matthews, wrote on 7 June 2005: "There will never be a 4.0." He expected 3.0.7 or 3.1.0 instead. Source: Wayback Machine capture of a ToolkitZone library post, <https://web.archive.org/web/20061006224635/http://toolkitzone.com/library.php?mode=read&doc=239&PHPSESSID=a820148b616163a5ea1de7ec3d784861>, as quoted by the project owner. TK Reawakened honours that: there is no "4.0", and we have our own name and version line.

## Decision

1. **Independent product, first release is v1.0.** We are **TK Reawakened** (abbreviated **TKR**; npm scope `@tk-reawakened`), not RPG Toolkit. We are a **tribute** to RPG Toolkit. We hope to bring back its community and its spirit, but we do not claim to be it, to continue it or to succeed it. "Successor" was a status the original team reserved for its founder, so we do not use the word about ourselves. We do not continue the RPG Toolkit 3 version line and are not "v4". "v1.0" describes the product, not any file format.
2. **Legacy compatibility is an import/playback feature, not an identity.** We read and play TK3 formats (`.gam`, `.brd`, `.prg` and related; see [the format spec](../spec/formats/README.md)) and aim to keep legacy worlds running. TK3 behaviour is a compatibility target, not a design constraint.
3. **A native format is permitted, not required.** Because we are not TK3, we are free to define our own format ("TKR", working name) **when legacy formats limit a feature**. Until that happens, legacy formats stay first-class. If it does, it is a major bump on the existing magic + major/minor header convention ([header and version](../spec/formats/README.md#header-and-version)), not a rewrite, and legacy formats are read through importers/converters (epics 2.8, 2.10) into it.
4. **Legacy-write support is not a promise.** Round-tripping to TK3 formats may be offered where cheap.
5. **Naming follows identity.** Package scopes, repo names, binaries and docs use TK Reawakened/TKR, never "RPG Toolkit" as our own name. Saying we are "a tribute to RPG Toolkit" describes lineage, not a name, and must not imply endorsement. "TK3" refers only to the legacy tool and its formats.

## Open questions

Not decided yet, and deliberately not decided here:

* Whether and when a native format is needed, and the first feature that justifies it.
* The name and extension of the native format ("TKR" is a placeholder).
* The npm scope and repository name (see §5).
* Container layout (folder of files vs single package) and how it relates to the distribution package writer (epic 2.12).
* Schema versioning and migration policy.
* Whether any TK3 formats remain first-class editable, or only importable.
* Branding and naming consequences of "not a TK version" (README, store listings, package names).

A follow-up ADR (or a native-format page in `docs/spec/formats/`) will settle these before the editor writes any project to disk.

## Consequences

* All docs, READMEs and package metadata should avoid "v3", "v4" or "next version" framing for the product itself. "TK3" refers only to the legacy tool and its formats.
* Format work must separate the *legacy reader* layer from the *native model*, so the native format can evolve without breaking importers.
* Goldens and corpus gates (G5) continue to validate legacy playback; native-format tests are added as that format is specified.
* Contributors and agents should treat compatibility with TK3 as a requirement of the importers and runner, not of the native data model.

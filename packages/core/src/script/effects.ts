/**
 * The effect record: what one built-in call did, as plain data in the `vm`
 * section (ticket 3.21; AD-7/AD-10/AD-11/AD-23; decision U1).
 *
 * Ticket 3.3 gave `ScriptServices` a temporary `effects` sink — a function the
 * VM called with each reported `CommandEffect`. That sink is not state: its
 * records carried no tick, no thread and no sequence, could not be saved or
 * restored, and vanished in a headless run. This module replaces it. A command
 * still never touches game state (AD-8/AD-10); it reports `CommandEffect`s, and
 * the VM stamps each into an `EffectRecord` and appends it to `vm.effects`,
 * where the section owners of later epics drain it (`drainEffects`) and apply
 * the change.
 *
 * The record is exactly the eleven fields the ticket fixes — `{ seq, tick,
 * thread, name, kind, args, out, result, patch, wait, request }` — and stays
 * `PlainData` (G1 rule 2, AD-11): no `undefined`, no `-0`, explicit `null` for
 * an absent value (AD-14). `AssertPlainData<EffectRecord>` proves it at build
 * time.
 *
 * Storage is one list, `vm.effects`, bounded by `EFFECT_LOG_CAP` (a ring: the
 * oldest record is evicted when the list is full), with a strictly monotonic
 * `vm.effectSeq` counter that is never reset — so `canon(save)` stays stable
 * across re-runs (G5).
 *
 * docs/adr/0004; discovery/command-effect-catalogue.md (sections 5–6).

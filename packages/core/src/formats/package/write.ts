/**
 * Writing the project's own distribution package (format-spec §13, AD-6).
 *
 * A distribution package is a `.tpk`-compatible ZIP — the same container the
 * reader in `zip.ts` accepts — holding the game files plus `manifest.json`
 * `{ schema, main, index }` at the archive root (AD-6). The manifest is the
 * package's descriptor, so a consumer can find the main file and know the asset
 * index without listing the archive:
 *
 * * `schema` — the project-level integer schema version (AD-23).
 * * `main` — the in-package path of the main file (the `.gam`, §1.5/§13). A
 *   package ignores the main file's `projectPath` (AD-5), so this names the file
 *   rather than a game-folder root.
 * * `index` — the relative paths the resolver keys on (AD-5): every game file in
 *   the tree, once each, written in code-unit order rather than the caller's.
 *   `manifest.json` is the descriptor itself, so it is not part of the index the
 *   writer takes; the reader's index does list it, being built from every
 *   archive entry.
 *
 * The writer's contract is that a package it emits is always one the landed
 * reader (`readZip`) accepts: every entry carries a CRC-32, entries are ordered
 * deterministically so the same input is byte-identical (G3), a per-entry
 * compression method is chosen so the §13 limits hold (a highly compressible
 * entry is stored rather than emitting a ratio above L5), and the finished bytes
 * are read back through `readZip` before they are returned. Anything that would
 * breach a limit or the path rules is a located `FormatError` naming the rule
 * (AD-17, AD-18); nothing here throws.
 *
 * `fflate/browser` is the only runtime dependency (AD-6): the synchronous
 * `deflateSync` (compression) and `strToU8` (names and the manifest's UTF-8
 * bytes). The ZIP container is laid out here rather than by `fflate`'s `zipSync`,
 * because `zipSync` stamps a DOS timestamp from the local clock and time zone —
 * `Date`'s local getters, which G3 bans in `core`. Every field the writer emits
 * comes from the input alone, so two writes are byte-identical (G3).
